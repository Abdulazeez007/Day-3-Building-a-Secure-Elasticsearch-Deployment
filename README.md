Elasticsearch is a powerful search and analytics engine that enables the fast and scalable search of data. In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll walk you through setting up an Elasticsearch instance on a Vultr Cloud server using Ubuntu 22.04.

## Step 1: Create a VPC and Ubuntu Server on Vultr Cloud

### Log into your Vultr Cloud Account:
1. Navigate to the Vultr Cloud dashboard.
2. Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
   - On the left sidebar, click on **Product** and then select **VPC 2.0**.

### Create a New Server:
1. Make sure the VPC 2.0 and the server are in the same location.
2. Click on **Create New Server** in the top right corner of your dashboard.
3. Select **Ubuntu 22.04** as your operating system.
4. For the plan, choose the **80GB NVMe** option.
